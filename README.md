Lately in computer programming 1, we have been practicing our coding with code wars, soliving problems that are given.  I have had fun with this because it is more fun when you are given a problem to solve, and after struggling through a problem and finally solving it, it is rewarding.  We worked on our new dice game, adding different rules and regulations to the game.  Each player rolled a nine sidded dice three times in a goal to roll the number 21, and the first person to roll 21 three times was the overall winner.  While I was able to complete this game, I have still been struggling with the def statements, but I hope to work on them this next week in preperation for the final exam.

This week in computer programming 1, I learned about def.  Def, short for define is a statement that will allow you to write some code, and then call it back later and it will all run under one line of code.  This was a hard concept to grasp at first, because I saw no need for the use of the def function.  However, after starting over with learning about it I realize the potential it has for helping me in the future.  We also refreshed on the different types of sort this week, and learned how to code each one of them.  It was a good refresher from computer fundamentals 1.  Finally, I  learned another important lesson this week, and that is to read through the homework instructions before you do the homework, so you do not show up to class thinking you have the homework done and find out it doesn't meet the requirements.

This week in computer programming 1, I learned about the while statement.  The while statement is used almost like an if statement, but it keeps looping until whatever it is looking for becomes false.  I also learned how to change the color of my text while working in putty, which I now do everytime before I start coding.  I was at the band trip during the end of last week and the beginning of this week, so I had to teach myself about the and and or statements.  The and is used when you need more than one thing to be true in an if statement.  While the or is used if only one thing is needed to be true.  Finally, I learned that when using the % sign is almost the same as division.  You use it to find out if something is odd or even, by using it with the number 2, and it then looks for any remainders, and if there is a remainder you know that it is odd.

This week in computer programming 1, I learned about if, else, and elif statements.  Learning these, opens another big door into the world of computer programming.  An if statement will allow you to perform an action only if a certain thing occurs.  While using an elif statement after the if statement, will allow you to allow another thing to occur if the otherstatements aren't true.

This weekend in computer programming 1, I learned a lot about string manipulation.  Now using python, I am able to take a string and it will rewrite in all capital letters.  I learned how to also make it rewrite in lowercase, and only one letter capitalized, and all but one letter capitalized.  I also learned on accident, that instead of using cd~ to get out of everythin, simply cd works the same, it may only be one character shorter, but it is fantastic for a lazy typer.  I also learned about how to find the number of characters within a certain string, and how to find the middle of a string, using len.  Also I have learned how to create a random number generator, and that using the up arrow can save having to retype alot of things.  Finally, I learned that something I learned in stats class this year was actually usefull using -1**99 to find the last letter of a string, or 1**99 to find the second letter of a string.

This week in computer programming 1, I learned the differences and uses for integer, floating point, string, and boolean variables.  Integers, take something and say they are equal to a value.  A floating point is a number with a decimal ex. 5.0.  A string is a string of words, ex "this is a reflection", and a boolean says something is either true or false.  I also learned that when making a mathmatical equation using code, make sure you always use foating point numbers, so that your answers come out correctly if there is a deciml point in the answer.

This week I learned more about github, and how it works.  I learned how to create a repository on github and how to connect it to ubuntu.  This week, I have also become more efficient in using ubuntu, and creating files and folders.  One very important thing I learned this week, is to not make a repository inside of another repository.  Finally, I have learned how to create bullet points and sub-bullet points while typing in the README.md files, that transfer to github.

During this first week of Computer Programming 1, I have learned quite a few things. First off, I learned that there are way more types of computer code than I thought there were. I also started learning how to use putty, making files, making folders, making folders in folders, making files in the folder in the folder, etc. I am looking forward to learning more throughout the semester.
