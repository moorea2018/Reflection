#Reflection 4
## 2/16/2018
This weekend in computer programming 1, I learned a lot about string manipulation.  Now using python, I am able to take a string and it will rewrite in all capital letters.  I learned how to also make it rewrite in lowercase, and only one letter capitalized, and all but one letter capitalized.  I also learned on accident, that instead of using cd~ to get out of everythin, simply cd works the same, it may only be one character shorter, but it is fantastic for a lazy typer.  I also learned about how to find the number of characters within a certain string, and how to find the middle of a string, using len.  Also I have learned how to create a random number generator, and that using the up arrow can save having to retype alot of things.  Finally, I learned that something I learned in stats class this year was actually usefull using -1**99 to find the last letter of a string, or 1**99 to find the second letter of a string.

This week in computer programming 1, I learned the differences and uses for integer, floating point, string, and boolean variables.  Integers, take something and say they are equal to a value.  A floating point is a number with a decimal ex. 5.0.  A string is a string of words, ex "this is a reflection", and a boolean says something is either true or false.  I also learned that when making a mathmatical equation using code, make sure you always use foating point numbers, so that your answers come out correctly if there is a deciml point in the answer.

This week I learned more about github, and how it works.  I learned how to create a repository on github and how to connect it to ubuntu.  This week, I have also become more efficient in using ubuntu, and creating files and folders.  One very important thing I learned this week, is to not make a repository inside of another repository.  Finally, I have learned how to create bullet points and sub-bullet points while typing in the README.md files, that transfer to github.

During this first week of Computer Programming 1, I have learned quite a few things. First off, I learned that there are way more types of computer code than I thought there were. I also started learning how to use putty, making files, making folders, making folders in folders, making files in the folder in the folder, etc. I am looking forward to learning more throughout the semester.
