# Reflection
## During this first week of Computer Programming 1, I have learned quite a few things. First off, I learned that there are way more types of computer code than I thought there were. I also started learning how to use putty, making files, making folders, making folders in folders, making files in the folder in the folder, etc. I am looking forward to learning more throughout the semester.
