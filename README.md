#Reflection 3
## 2/9/2018
This week in computer programming 1, I learned the differences and uses for integer, floating point, string, and boolean variables.  Integers, take something and say they are equal to a value.  A floating point is a number with a decimal ex. 5.0.  A string is a string of words, ex "this is a reflection", and a boolean says something is either true or false.  I also learned that when making a mathmatical equation using code, make sure you always use foating point numbers, so that your answers come out correctly if there is a deciml point in the answer.

This week I learned more about github, and how it works.  I learned how to create a repository on github and how to connect it to ubuntu.  This week, I have also become more efficient in using ubuntu, and creating files and folders.  One very important thing I learned this week, is to not make a repository inside of another repository.  Finally, I have learned how to create bullet points and sub-bullet points while typing in the README.md files, that transfer to github.

During this first week of Computer Programming 1, I have learned quite a few things. First off, I learned that there are way more types of computer code than I thought there were. I also started learning how to use putty, making files, making folders, making folders in folders, making files in the folder in the folder, etc. I am looking forward to learning more throughout the semester.
