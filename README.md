# Reflection 2
## 2/2/2018
This week I learned more about github, and how it works.  I learned how to create a repository on github and how to connect it to ubuntu.  This week, I have also become more efficient in using ubuntu, and creating files and folders.  One very important thing I learned this week, is to not make a repository inside of another repository.  Finally, I have learned how to create bullet points and sub-bullet points while typing in the README.md files, that transfer to github.

# Reflection 1
## 1/26/2018
During this first week of Computer Programming 1, I have learned quite a few things. First off, I learned that there are way more types of computer code than I thought there were. I also started learning how to use putty, making files, making folders, making folders in folders, making files in the folder in the folder, etc. I am looking forward to learning more throughout the semester.
